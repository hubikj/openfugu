# OpenFugu — Architecture

## Overview

OpenFugu is an open-source Android app for the eFugu freediving BLE pressure training device. The app connects to one or more eFugu devices via Bluetooth LE, reads real-time nasal pressure data, and provides games, exercises, and visualization tools for equalization training.

The app is built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose (Material 3), and targets modern Android (API 35+). There are no XML layouts — all UI is Compose.

## Data Flow

### BLE → UI Pipeline

```
eFugu device (BLE notification, ASCII Pascals, ~20 Hz)
  ↓  (all GATT callbacks are Handler-confined to the main thread)
DeviceConnection.gattCallback.onCharacteristicChanged()
  ↓ parse ASCII → Double (finite values only), subtract ambient baseline → relativeHPa
PressureReading(pressureHPa, relativeHPa, timestamp)
  ↓ ring buffer (60 min) + StateFlows
latestPressure (every sample)     chartData (immutable snapshots)
  ↓                                ↓
Display and games collect via     PressureChart renders the visible
collectAsState() (conflated       window (binary-searched slice)
per frame); sample-counting
detectors (PeakDetector,
SustainedPressureDetector)
collect the flow directly in a
LaunchedEffect so no samples drop
  ↓
Games read latestPressure each frame;
session traces come from historySnapshot() at save time
```

The algorithmic core (detectors, RangeTracker, range derivation, game
mapping, session JSON) is unit-tested in `app/src/test/`, and its behavior
is specified platform-neutrally in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md).

### State Management

`EFuguViewModel` (AndroidViewModel) is the single source of truth:

| State | Type | Persistence |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `connections` | `Map<String, DeviceConnection>` | In-memory only |
| `savedDevices` | `List<SavedDevice>` | SharedPreferences (JSON) |
| `userProfiles` | `List<UserProfile>` | SharedPreferences (JSON) |
| `deviceUserPairings` | `List<DeviceUserPairing>` | SharedPreferences (JSON) |
| `recentSessions` | `List<SessionIndexEntry>` | JSON files (app internal storage) |
| `scanState` | `ScanState` | In-memory only |
| `scannedDevices` | `List<ScannedDevice>` | In-memory only |
| `logMessages` | `List<String>` | In-memory only |

Each `DeviceConnection` owns its own state:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `state` | Connecting / Connected / Disconnected / Error |
| `latestPressure` | Most recent PressureReading (null until calibrated) |
| `chartData` | Rolling 60-minute pressure history (~72000 samples at 20 Hz) |
| `chartMin` / `chartMax` | Running min/max of relative pressure |
| `batteryLevel` | 0-100% (from standard Battery Service) |
| `deviceInfo` | Firmware, hardware, serial, manufacturer |
| `isCalibrated` | True after ambient baseline is established (~20 samples) |

## Navigation

The app uses a flat navigation model — no navigation library. Full-screen routing is handled by state flags in `EFuguApp`:

```
EFuguApp {
  if (showLogs)           → full-screen LogsTab with back button
  if (showUserDetail)     → full-screen UserDetailScreen
  if (viewingSessionId)   → full-screen SessionViewerScreen
  if (calibratingUserId)  → full-screen CalibrationWizard
  if (activeGame)         → full-screen game/exercise (no chrome)
  else                    → Scaffold with bottom tabs
}
```

Bottom tabs: **Live** | **Exercises** | **Devices** | **Users**

Logs are accessible from the top-right icon on the main screen. The Logs
screen header shows the app version (from `BuildConfig`), and the version is
also the first line logged on startup so it rides along in copied logs.

### First-run guidance

There is no stored "onboarded" flag — guidance derives from state:
- No saved devices → the app starts on the Devices tab, which shows a
  welcome card (auto-scan already runs on open).
- A device connects while no user profiles exist → a dialog offers to
  create the first user and pairs it to that device.
- After creating a user (from the first-run dialog or the Users tab), a
  dialog offers to launch the calibration wizard.

### Session import

`MainActivity` runs as `launchMode="singleTask"` and registers `ACTION_VIEW`
/ `ACTION_SEND` intent filters for `application/octet-stream` — sessions are
shared as `.fugu` files (JSON inside), which receiving apps resolve to that
MIME type. Incoming intents (onCreate or onNewIntent) flow into `EFuguApp`
as Compose state; `EFuguViewModel.importSession` validates and saves the
session into history, then the standard session viewer opens it. Foreign
files are rejected with a toast.

## Key Design Decisions

### Multi-device from the start
`connections` is a `Map<String, DeviceConnection>` — every device has independent state. The UI adapts: single device = full panel, multiple = scrollable compact cards.

### User ≠ Device
Users (profiles with calibration data) and devices (BLE hardware) are separate entities linked by `DeviceUserPairing`. One user can be paired to multiple devices. In a group setting, an instructor can quickly reassign users to different devices via the device picker.

### Calibration is per-user, not per-device
Calibration results (min EQ, max positive, max negative) are stored on `UserProfile`. When launching a game, the app looks up the user paired to the selected device to get pressure range and expert mode settings.

### Unified PressureChart
One chart composable used everywhere (Live tab, calibration wizard, exercises). Optional overlay parameters add exercise-specific features (peak markers, target range, scoring-colored line segments) without separate chart implementations.

### Game pressure mapping
All games use `calculateTargetY()` from GameUtils.kt. Normal mode: 0 hPa = bottom, pressureRange = top. Expert mode: 0 hPa = center, positive maps upper half, negative maps lower half (asymmetric ranges).

### No "active user" concept
User context flows from device pairing. Games/exercises get their settings from `viewModel.userForDevice(address)` based on which device is selected. The Users tab shows a list — tapping a user opens their detail screen directly.

## Persistence

**SharedPreferences (JSON strings)** — small, frequently accessed data:
- `SavedDevice` — address, name, nickname, color, lastConnectedAt
- `UserProfile` — calibration data, game range settings, expert mode
- `DeviceUserPairing` — device address ↔ user ID

**File storage** (`context.filesDir/sessions/`) — large session recordings:
- One JSON file per session (`session_{id}.json`) with full pressure trace
- Index file (`sessions_index.json`) for fast listing without loading traces
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename); all I/O runs on Dispatchers.IO behind a
  mutex; serialization lives in `SessionJson` (pure, covered by round-trip tests)
- Auto-cleanup: keeps last 50 sessions, deletes oldest on save
- Session types: `MinEqSession` (with peak markers), `ConstantEqSession` (with range/scoring data), `GameSession` (with score and pressure bounds), `MultiplayerGameSession` (per-player results)
- Pressure traces are filtered to the exercise/game time window, not the full rolling buffer

## BLE Protocol

See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for full BLE protocol documentation.

Key points:
- Pressure data comes from a custom service (not the auth service)
- ASCII Pascals at ~20 Hz, no CCCD write needed
- Auth is device-proves-identity via RSA signature (not required for pressure)
- The `dcdf` characteristic purpose is still unknown
